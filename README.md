# TranquilCarbon's Script Repo
Welcome to my script Repo! This repo contains various scripts made for various tasks. for a full list of what the folders contain, open "Script_Description.md"
# Folders
Each of the scripts are seprated into folders, depending on what they are meant to run on. these include:
## Batch
intended to run via the Windows command prompt.

## Old-Broken
scripts of various functionality. Some of these have been replaced with newer ones with more functionality, while others just don't work.

## Powershell

Intended to run on Windows Powershell. Will probably work on the Linux version too.

## Python

Intended to run with any Python you have installed. May require PIP to install any missing dependancies. tested with official python.
