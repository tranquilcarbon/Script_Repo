# old-broken
## Find_File_Hash.bat
A older, batch version of the find file hash script. Does the same thing but in a far more inefficient way!

## NewHasher.ps1
A file hashing utility, provide a folder path (for example C:\windows\) and it will go through the folder and any subfolders, hashing any files inside. Uses get-filehash and gets MD5 (insecure), SHA1 (insecure) and SHA256

## fontgen.py
earlier in 2023 i experimented using AI To generate a easy to use way to generate sample pages to show fonts in action, however, the script suffered from many problems including not actually working, I determined the project to take too much time compared to just making each page myself.

## gethashes.ps1
A older powershell file hashing script. It does the job i guess?

# Python

## Random_PC_Name
